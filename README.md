# Replication-Pack-24
INSTRUCTIONS: 
to gain access to the script, open "final_project_script.R", which has the code for my findings. To access the dataset, open "raw_data.csv". 

DATA:
My data was the analyses of full Grey's Anatomy episodes. My question for the project was if it was true that all Grey's Anatomy episodes that are over dramatized and extreme are more important to the overall show, and that there are no filler episodes that are just as important. My unit of analysis was episodes, and I overall watched/collected 30 observations. These observations were randomly sampled.
I was able to get my data by using a spinner to randomly choose 30 episodes, which I then watched and analyzed differing components of it. I watched for themes of violence, tracked what I believed the emotion level of the episode would be, and noted what the overall mood of the episode was, positive or negative. I personally have watched the whole show, so along with analyzing components of specific episodes, I analyzed how important it is to the entire series (not season, episode, storyline).

OPERATIONALIZATION: 
For the violence variable, I used a qualitative scale, that went: calming, heavy, violent, extremely. Calming describes an episode in which no part was there violence or violent themes. Heavy describes an episode with heavy topics but not ‘violent’ in the sense that there is danger to a character or characters. Violent describes an episode that includes themes that are concerning a character/characters being harmed and hurt. Extremely describes an episode that includes horrific incidents that are very violent, and a character is harmed or dies.
For the emotional variable, I used a quantitative scale, that ranged from 1-30. Episodes that I felt were less emotional, and didn't effect me as much, I put on the lower end of this scale and the opposite for episodes that were extremely emotional and effected me. 
For the positive_vs_negative variable, I used a qualitative scale that was either positive or negative. Positive describes episodes that are mainly focused on characters positive/comedic daily life. Negative describes episodes that are mainly focused on a tragedy to character/characters, or had no happy or comedic storyline intertwined with the regular medical parts.
For the important variable, I used a quantitative scale, that again ranged from 1-30. Episodes that were less important to the overline story of Grey's Anatomy, and weren't impactful to move the story along were put on the lower end of this scale and vise-versa.
